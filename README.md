# Quality-Dashboard


## Description

This dashboard is a project I created during a Power BI course at Workearly (https://www.workearly.gr/), where I earned my Data Science certification. It demonstrates my proficiency in Power BI.

The quality dashboard displays the overall quality score of the department, as well as the quality scores for each supervisor's team and by work location. Additionally, it shows the total samples, defects, and fatal errors made by each employee. You can also view the sampling percentage by supervisor and the monthly sums of fatal errors for the first eight months of the year. By hovering over each supervisor, you can see the individual quality scores of all employees in their team.
